Nero is the recommended software for burning Hyperscan CD's according to Sunplus, although any cd burning software will work theoretically.

### TLDR
Burn the files into the root of the cd including the Hyper.exe executable

### Items Needed
Any CD Burning Software [Nero 7.10.1.0](nero.md)[Recommended]  
A CD-R

### Steps
1) Open up your CD Burning software

3) Set the File Name Length to either *Max of 11 chars(ISO Level 1)* or *Max of 31 chars(ISO Level 2)*
5) Set the data mode to *Mode 1*
6) Set the Character set to *ISO9660 (standard ISO CD-ROM)*
7) Make sure Juliet file system **isn't enabled**
8) Make sure to **Finalize CD (No further writing possible!)**
