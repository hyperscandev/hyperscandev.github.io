# Installing Nero

## Overview
Nero is the recommended software for burning Hyperscan CD's according to a Sunplus leaked document. The latest version of Nero costs **$$$** so instead
we are going to install an older version around the time the Hyperscan was released.

### TLDR
Install [Nero 7.10.1.0](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/nero-7-10-1-0)  
Register software using license key

### Items Needed
[Nero 7.10.1.0](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/nero-7-10-1-0)  
A Windows PC

### Steps
1) Download Nero 7.10.1.0 from [here](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/nero-7-10-1-0)
2) Double-click the setup file to start the installer
3) When asked if you have a serial number enter `1C80-0000-19E5-MA2X-4006-3632-3745` into the textbox. If that doesn't work try to copy and paste it instead
4) Follow the rest of the instructions until the installation is complete.

### Troubleshooting
Copy and paste License key instead of manually typing it in  
Make sure your using the correct version *7.10.0.1* linked above  
Nero is a Windows application, it won't run on Mac or Linux to my knowledge *sorry* ðŸ˜ž
