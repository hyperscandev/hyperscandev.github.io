# Installing Nero

## Overview
Nero is the recommended software for burning Hyperscan CD's according to a Sunplus leaked document. The latest version of Nero costs **$$$** so instead
we are going to install an older version around the time the Hyperscan was released.

### TLDR
Install [Nero 7.10.1.0](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/nero-7-10-1-0)  
Register software using license key

### Items Needed
[Nero 7.10.1.0](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/nero-7-10-1-0)  
A Windows PC

### Steps
1) Download Nero 7.10.1.0 from [here](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/nero-7-10-1-0)
2) Double-click the setup file to start the installer
3) When asked if you have a serial number hit skip. We only are going to use the demo mode. If you find a license key online, use that. I can't help you, but
   all I can say is *Google* is your friend.
5) Follow the rest of the instructions until the installation is complete.

### Troubleshooting
Copy and paste the License key you found instead of manually typing it in  
Make sure your using the correct version *7.10.0.1* linked above  
Nero is a Windows application, it won't run on Mac or Linux to my knowledge *sorry* ðŸ˜ž
